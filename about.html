            <p>Hi, If you're here you want more information about me!Well I have been around technology my whole life.When I was a child I was always fascinated with computers,and video games.Since we got our first computer I was addicted, windows 95 with at the time very little processing power.Since then I developed a passion for computers, years later in high school I built my first computer using components that i had saved up for all summer.It had the latest and greatest and could play the best games of the time.</p><br />
			<p>By this time I had been introduced to various technologies and had become educated on different parts of a computer.I was fascinated from the very basic parts, the motherboard,processor,RAM,Graphical Processing Unit, and so on. I wanted to learn more, about how these parts made the computer work, how information was processed and how the software was used and integrated.</p><br  />
			<p>College came around, I began college with Aerospace Engineering  discipline, and after a few basic classes, I had been introduced to Matlab. We were given various tasks to do, like navigating through mazes and writing code for card games.It had become apparent to me by then what I wanted to do.To become knowledgeable with programming,computers and software related with our everyday lives.</p><br  />
			<p>From here my passion had grown. I started learning Java and dealing with basic problems like palindromes, and Object oriented problems such as polymorphism.This progressed to learning other aspects of programming as a whole, Linked Lists,2d Arrays, and other storage mechanisms.Later in my career I was introduced to HTMl,PHP,Python,and C/C++. These consisted of projects mostly and all of them were with groups.</p><br  />
			<p>After learning all the basics I dove into some different area's of technology.Computer Gaming and Graphics was the start,I wrote a few 2D scene's using OpenGL and then progressed to Games.I developed a few games using Pygame, and have touched grounds with some modelling software used for Unity and other game engines. After all these I  took in some fundamentals of software engineering like development and prototype cycles,as well as specification and requirement documentation.</p><br  />
			<p>During my career I want to continue learning new things and gain experience with other technologies, such as mobile apps, and standalone desktop applications.As a programmer I would also like to learn new tools and coding practices to make better applications.</p>
