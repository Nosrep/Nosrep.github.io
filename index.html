            <p>Hi, Im Anthony Glitzner and I am a recent graduate of West Virginia University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Throughout my college career I have studied various languages and had experience in different subcategories.My goal is to continue learning all aspects of programming and technology.The one thing that is always true about Computer Science, There is always something new and exciting to learn.</p><br />
        <p>The Goal for this site is to introduce employers or colleagues in the field,to my personal experience as a programmer, and serve as a digital resume.</p><br />

        <h1>Projects</h1>
            <div class="contentText">
			  <p> During my career I have contributed to various projects in different disciplines.Here are some examples:</p><br />
			  <ul>
			    <li>File and Data Structure</li>
				<li>Operating Systems</li>
				<li>Computer Graphics</li>
				<li>Computer Gaming</li>
			  </ul><br />
			  
        <p>File and Data Structure project was written in Java under windows and Ubuntu Linux operating systems.The goal was to create a system like MySQL. During this project the class had 1 semester to implement this system, and were given the project in nine parts to complete with design specifications and a library of keywords to implement.</p><br />
        <p>Operating Systems was an interesting class.The goal was to create a simple operating system that could create and destroy processes, under this system the group had to write in the C programming language using the Turbo C compiler.This was an interesting project and consisted of many long nights supplimented with Redbull.</p><br  />
        <p>Computer Graphics was various projects during the course of a semester.Most of these projects were written using OpenGL in windows to get the basics.The final project was a big scene with multiple light sorces and camera manipulation.</p><br />
        <p>Computer Gaming was taken in my last semester at WVU. Multiple simple projects with a term project were programmed.Various technologies were used including PyGame,processing,and some music software.The term project was sponsored by SleepWell a WVU program to help students with good sleeping habits.</p><br  /></div>
		
        <h1>Technology</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
		  <p>Operating Systems:</p><br />
		      <ul>
			    <li>Windows xp,vista,7,8</li>
				<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
			  </ul><br />
          <p>Languages:</p><br />
		      <ul>
			    <li>Python</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>C/C++</li>
				<li>basic OpenGL</li>
				<li>basic HTML</li>
			  </ul><br  />
			<p>During my studies I have learned the essence of programming.This makes it easier to learn new languages, which I am always interested in to broaden my skills as a programmer.</p><br />
